# 👋 Hi, I’m @jaredkc

I am a designer and full stack developer based in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Day-to-day I can be found working with incredible brands in fast-growing industries for enthusiasts; all interests of New Value Capital. I am business-oriented and passionate about solving everything from visual design to technical software solutions.

This is why I've become a Swiss Army knife at my trade: One day creating a visual solution for the project at hand, the next implementing the solution in code.

- 👀 I’m interested in TypeScript, React, and Flutter
- ⏱ I'm spending a lot of time in the Shopify ecosystem
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... 🤔, everything! It's a never ending journey.
