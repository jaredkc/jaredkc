# 👋 Hi, I’m @jaredkc

I am a designer and full-stack developer based in Salt Lake City, Utah.

I work with incredible brands in fast-growing industries for enthusiasts. I am business-oriented and passionate about solving everything from visual design to technical software solutions.

This is why I've become a Swiss Army knife at my trade: One day, I create a visual solution for the project at hand, and the next, I implement the solution in code.

- 👀 I’m interested in Remix, Shopify Hydrogen, TypeScript, and Laravel
- ⏱ I'm spending a lot of time in the Shopify ecosystem
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... 🤔, everything! It's a never-ending journey.
